### OVERVIEW ###
Build an interactive, historical timeline with simple HTML, CSS, and jQuery

### REQUIREMENTS ###
-jQuery
-Optional: Jack Moore's ColorBox jQuery plugin

### USAGE ###
1. Wrap your timeline in an element with an ID of timelineContainer (e.g., <div id="timelineContainer">)

2. Separate the major marker content (e.g., content for each century, year, decade etc) into elements with a class of timelineMajor (e.g., <div class="timelineMajor">)

3. Wrap the major markers in an element with a class of 'timelineMajorMarker' (e.g., <h2 class="timelineMajorMarker">1954</h2>)

4. Separate the individual events into DL elements with a class of timelineMinor (e.g., <dl class="timelineMinor">)

5. Wrap the title of the individual events in a DT and A tag; give each DT a unique ID (e.g., <dt id="19540517"><a>Brown vs Board of Education</a></dt>)

6. Wrap the (hidden) content of each event in a DL tag; give each DL an ID based on the DT with 'EX' appended, a class of 'timeline', and set the display to 'none' (e.g., <dd class="timelineEvent" id="19540517EX" style="display: none; ">)

7. Optional: Add an expand/collapse all events by adding the following inside of the main #timelineContainer:

<div class="timelineToggle"><p><a class="expandAll">+ expand all</a></p></div>
