### OVERVIEW ###
Build a simple, interactive, historical timeline with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The benefits of this timeline script are (1) its simplicity, (2) an ability to handle nearly any form of content, and (3) its printer friendly markup. There's plenty of room for you to get creative with the styling too.

Other, more complex timeline plugins are available. If your needs are far greater than those provided here, consider one of the following:

### REQUIREMENTS ###
-jQuery
-Optional: Jack Moore's ColorBox jQuery plugin

### USAGE ###
1. Wrap your timeline in an element with an ID of timelineContainer (e.g., <div id="timelineContainer">)

2. Separate the major marker content (e.g., content for each century, year, decade etc) into elements with a class of timelineMajor (e.g., <div class="timelineMajor">)

3. Wrap the major markers in an element with a class of 'timelineMajorMarker' (e.g., <h2 class="timelineMajorMarker">1954</h2>)

4. Separate the individual events into DL elements with a class of timelineMinor (e.g., <dl class="timelineMinor">)

5. Wrap the title of the individual events in a DT and A tag; give each DT a unique ID (e.g., <dt id="19540517"><a>Brown vs Board of Education</a></dt>)

6. Wrap the (hidden) content of each event in a DL tag; give each DL an ID based on the DT with 'EX' appended, a class of 'timeline', and set the display to 'none' (e.g., <dd class="timelineEvent" id="19540517EX" style="display: none; ">)

7. Optional: Add an expand/collapse all events by adding the following inside of the main #timelineContainer:

<div class="timelineToggle"><p><a class="expandAll">+ expand all</a></p></div>

### SAMPLE ###

A timeline with only one major marker and one event would look like this:

	<div id="timelineContainer">
		<div class="timelineMajor">
			<h2 class="timelineMajorMarker">Major Marker</h2>
			<dl class="timelineMinor">
				<dt id="event01"><a>Event</a></dt>
				<dd class="timelineEvent" id="event01EX" style="display: none; ">
					<p>Content about the event goes here.</p>
				</dd><!-- /.timelineEvent -->
			</dl><!-- /.timelineMinor -->
		</div><!-- /.timelineMajor -->
	</div><!-- /#timelineContainer -->
